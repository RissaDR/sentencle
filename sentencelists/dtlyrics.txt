And then I woke up
You can make a fortune in lies
You can keep a giant alive
Here is a poor man
He said we both will be heroes
I was led into temptation
You rode the red
I want to know you now
Nothing is sacred
You draw the bottom line
You refused to believe
Descending scarlet cuts the sky
The wheels race back
Revelation warms a touch
He is risen
Our savior must make his stand
He heard my voice
It was my choice
The sea is calling me
My spirit must return
No one is left now
Stop your hands from shaking
Look at me
I can see
You lie alone with the memory
I search within
We were racing the rain
My hands held the wheel
My eyes tried to hold their place
It must have been a cloud
Outside I watched you burn
Heavy hearts were bleeding
My melting hands streaked the glass
I felt my hands upon the wheel
I locked the door behind me
My mind was still a wreck
I can still find the courage
