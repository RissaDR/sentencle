Lost in the sky
Clouds roll by
And I roll with them
Arrows fly
Seas increase
And then fall again
This world is spinning around me
This world is spinning without me
Every day sends future to past
Every breath leaves me one less to my last
Watch the sparrow falling
Gives new meaning to it all
If not today nor yet tomorrow
Then some other day
As sure as I did ever love him
I am not afraid
This world is spinning around me
The whole world keeps spinning around me
All life is future to past
Pull me under
All that I feel is honor and spite
All I can do is set it right
Dust fills my eyes
Centuries cry
Orders fly
And I fall again
This world is spinning inside me
The whole world is spinning inside of me
Every step brings me closer to my last
Living my life too much in the sun
Only until your will is done
Live another day
Climb a little higher
Find another reason to stay
Ashes in your hands
Mercy in your eyes
So die another day
Look another way
So try another day
They took pictures of ourdreams
Ran to hide behind the stairs
Resist the need to pull them in
And throw them away
Better to save the mystery
Than surrender to the secret
Go back to square one
There is something that I feel
To be something that is real
I feel the heat within my mind
And craft new changes with my eyes
Giving freely wandering promises
You can feel the waves coming on
Let them destroy you or carry you on
But no one can save you this time
Close your eyes
You can find all you need in your mind
The unbroken spirit
Obscured and disquiet
Finds clearness this trial demands
And at the end of this day sighs an anxious relief
For the fortune lies still in his hands
A man must learn to cope
Suppression that he feels must turn to hope
Life is no more assuring than love
There are no answers from voices above
And no one can save you this time
I close my eyes
And feel the water rise around me
Drown the bead of time
Let my senses fall away
I can see much clearer now
If you take the time
Morning comes too early
And nighttime falls too late
And sometimes all I want to do is wait
She will slowly yield the light
As I awaken from the longest night
Dreams are shaking
Set sirens waking up tired eyes
By a candle stands a mirror
Of his heart and soul she dances
She was dancing through the night
He throws the shutters out
Let light surround you
In the end he only sees the change
Light to dark
Dark to light
Heaven must be more than this
When angels waken with a kiss
But mine will never be the same
He stands before the windows
Once lost but I was found
But I will hold this one on high
She whispers words to clear my mind
I once could see but now at last
Surrounded in all the light
Tell me
Remind me
Always beside me
Taste the memories running from my eyes
Nervous flashlights scan my dreams
Liquid shadows silence their screams
I smile at the moon
Chasing water from the sky
I argue with the clouds
Stealing beauty from my eyes
Outside the soundness of your mind
Bathing your soul in silver tears
Beneath a blackened summer sky
Praying for time to disappear
Beneath a summer sky
Under glass moonlight
Liquid shadows crawl
Silver teardrops fall
The bride subsides to her survival
By your hand
Bear this honor in my name
Standing by the window
Eyes upon the moon
Hoping that the memory
will leave his spirit soon
She shuts the doors and lights
And lays her body on the bed
Images and words are running deep
She stares at the ceiling
But the feeling is gone
And call life from a cold metal frame
In with the ashes
Or up with the smoke from the fire
With wings up in heaven
Palm of her hand to my head
Now and forever curled in my heart
And the heart of the world
There was no time for pain
No energy for anger
Walking through winter streets alone
He stops and take a breath
I look at the world and see no understanding
I need to live life
Like some people never will
So find me kindness
Find me beauty
Find me truth
When temptation brings me to my knees
And I lay here drained of strength
Show me kindness
Show me beauty
Show me truth
The way your heart sounds
It makes all the difference
The way your heart beats
In learning to live
Here before me is my soul
Listening to the city
Whispering its violence
I set out watching from above
New solutions to be found
I fell in love to be let down
Once again we dance in the crowd
At times a step away
Once I reached for love
And now I reach for life
Another chance to lift my life
Free the sensation in my heart
To ride the wings of dreams
into changing horizons
It brings inner peace within my mind
I hear an innocent voice
