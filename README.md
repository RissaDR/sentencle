# Sentencle

Sentencle is a parody of the web-based word game Wordle; in Wordle you have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, where in Sentencle you have *one attempt* to guess a sentence of any given length. The sentence, as the word does in Wordle, changes every day.

The website is reverse engineered from the original Wordle website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and is mobile responsive.

Sentencle can be played where it is hosted at www.sentencle.xyz/
